        </h2>
        <p><strong>Trader Joes Onion Salt</strong>
            <br>

            This ingredient is amazing and tasty in every dish! Whether you are making a hot meal or need the ingredient
            for a dip, it adds the necessary flavor. I typically like to add it to yogurt. Most people look at it and
            think it is ranch but trust me! This will not disappoint at all for a party. Its simple and healthy. Another
            way I generally use it, is on my breakfast or in a soup.

            <br><br>

            <strong>Cholula</strong>
            <br>
            My favorite thing is to mix this hot spicy sauce on my chicken and or in my eggs for breakfast. This is a
            quick and easy way to enjoy a meal and add that spicy kick in your day!

            <br><br>

            <strong>Avocados</strong>
            <br>
            Avocados are healthy on their own, but I love them with a good breakfast meal. You can mash, slice and or
            cut them in half. They lower cholesterol and are full of fiber. There is no excuse to avoid eating one,
            unless you really dislike avocados.

            <br><br>

            <strong>Mushrooms</strong>
            <br>
            I enjoy using mushrooms in almost every meal I make. It adds a different texture to my eggs and provides a
            feeling of being full. Mushrooms can practically be used in any dish. I typically eat mushrooms with some
            scrambled eggs in the morning. They also make a fabulous side.

            <br><br>

            <strong>Feta</strong>
            <br>
            I love a good feta salad! Sprinkling a tad bit of feta on a meal adds a salty taste. Try to garnish your
            meals with feta and you will be in love!

            <br><br>

            <strong>Blueberry Goat cheese</strong>
            <br>
            Trader Joes has a great goat cheese log. I bring this to house parties and people love it. All you need are
            some crackers and bam! You've got a gourmet for the broke girl recipe. And you'll look fancy as well.

            <br><br>

            <strong>Olive Oil</strong>
            <br>
            My favorite oil to cook with is Olive Oil. This is a must have in my kitchen. Trader Joes has one for $3.99.
            It lasts about 2 months. I prefer this over butter, but lately I have been giving butter a try with my
            cooking. Can't complain, both are good. But Iâ€™m an olive oil kind of lady.
