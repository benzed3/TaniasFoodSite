                    <p>We all love to eat things with names like “masiago” and “prosciutto.” We like to put on heels,
                        and sit in
                        a
                        restaurant drinking $12 cocktails with black cherries and branches sticking out of them. But
                        let’s be
                        real.
                        That can break the bank pretty quickly.
                        <br><br>
                        Preparing meals in your own kitchen doesn’t have to mean paper plates and pizza (although that
                        has never
                        let
                        me down, personally). And crafting a fancy meal doesn’t require complex ingredients. As the
                        child of a
                        Salvadoran mother and a Jordanian father, I was quickly forced to love flavorful spices. I grew
                        up in a
                        family-owned restaurant. I loved the sense of community it inspired every day—but I got tired of
                        eating
                        the
                        same meals over and over again. The only way to combat that monotony was to get creative, and
                        start
                        experimenting with the ingredients available to me. My stomach definitely did all of the talking
                        back
                        then—and it still does today.
                        <br><br>
                        As a fun-loving girl with a big appetite—and a small budget—I’ve learned a few things over the
                        years.
                        First,
                        cooking can be therapeutic, and my meals are often a reflection of how I feel each day. Second,
                        coming
                        up
                        with new recipes is a great way to satiate my desire to create something unique. Third, Trader
                        Joe’s is
                        a
                        broke girl’s best friend.

                        That’s how I came up with Gourmet for the Broke Girl. I’m not a health coach or fitness guru,
                        and I
                        don’t
                        subscribe to any particular diet. But I do believe in using fresh ingredients to create healthy
                        options
                        that
                        actually taste good. I promise, your body will thank you in return. So, let’s get cookin’.
                        the body.
